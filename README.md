# FireSpreading
Test task I received from a corp. I've done it successfully but unfortunately they've closed position due to financial situation.

The goal of this task is to create a simple system simulating the spreading of fire among plants while taking into account the direction and speed of the wind. 

It was also necessary to make plant spawner and there was optional task to make a simple game based on simulation. 

In this repo there are two builds (simulation and game) and source of project.
